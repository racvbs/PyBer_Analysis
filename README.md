# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 - Challenge
## Overview of Project
Pyber is a company who has informations of maded rides by city, type (of ride), date and fare.

They need to create summary dataframes to analyze their information.

### Information
We have 2 files:

city_data.csv
* city
* driver_count
* type

ride_data.csv
* city
* date
* fare
* ride_id

With this information we merge both files into one dataframe.

## Analysis
The dataframe we have is:

But we need a summary by city type, so the calculations were made and there are shown in this data frame:

**Conclusions: Despite there are much more urban rides, the average amount per ride and also per driver is bigger in rural rides**

**There are two ways to analize this, one is to increase urban rides in order to be more popular or give more promotion of rural rides because are more expensive.**

Then, we have a graphic with the information of total fare by city type per week, to know the behavior of the variable.

**Conclusions:**

**Rural rides are low in the first weeks of the month, may work to have promotions that days**
**On the contrary, urban rides are high in the first weeks of the month, in order to make the time larger that rides are increasing, may work to have publicity**
**For suburban rides we need more information**
